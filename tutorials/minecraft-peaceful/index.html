        <h2>Minecraft Peaceful Speedrun Guide</h2>
      
        <h3>Basics</h3>

        <p>Let’s start. On this speedrun, I use minecraft 1.8.9, as the seed can be different in other versions.</p>
        <p>The seed is: 2004103968544575047</p>
        <p>Note: This seed is a good one for this category, but it can be pretty stressful.</p>  
    
        <h3>The Temple</h3>

        <p>When you start, make sure you don’t move, and change the difficulty to peaceful.</p>
        <img class ="frame" src="set-difficulty.png" />

        <p>Then, make your way to the temple (turn to your right)</p>
        <img class="frame" src="get-to-temple.png" />

        <h3>Inside The Temple</h3>

        <p>Once you are on the temple, you want to make a saircase.</p>
        <img class ="frame" src="dig-stairs.png" />

        <p>Then, you want to break that block (careful!!)</p> 
        <img class ="frame" src="dig-on-block.png" />

        <h3>Inside The Temple (2)</h3>
        <p>Next, being really careful, break the block that is  under the pressure plate.</p>
        <p>Then, grab all the tnt and use one block or sand to get out of the hole.</p>
        <p>Grab all the iron and gold!!</p>
        <p>With the remaining blocks, pillar up the hole you made earlier.</p>

        <img class ="frame" src="get-the-loot.png" />
        <img class ="frame" src="pillar-up.png" />

        <h3>The Village</h3>
        <p>This is the stressful part (sometimes)</p>
        <p>Once out of the temple,  go left, and you will see a village.</p>
        <p>From here I don’t know how to explain it, so I’ll try my best. Here is an example, as it’s better to see someone do it.</p>

        <iframe class="frame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwfoh48k54w?start=139" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3>Village Explanation</h3>
        <p>Basically, what he does it collect the carrots and potatoes, while finding the cleric and the farmer.</p>
        <p>Then, he goes to the farmer, and gives him the food in an order, this will give you 8 emeralds.</p>
        <p>Then, he goes to the cleric, and gives him the things in order. Note!! it’s really important you do it perfectly (breaking some wood to reset him, taking the redstone, although you are not going to use it, and more).</p>
      
        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>Once you get the pickaxe and shovel, make your way to the stronghold, and grab some grass on the way there. Then, get to this exact place and dig straight down.</p>
        <p>Then, go to the end, and pillar up  on the top right corner, then, pillar up the towers and kill the dragon!</p>
